# Cryptocurrency Price Forecaster: Fusion of Technology and Finance

## Overview
This project aims to predict cryptocurrency prices using advanced machine learning models. It leverages a combination of ARIMA, LSTM, GRU, and TCN models along with sentiment analysis to forecast cryptocurrency trends.

## Data
The project utilizes the `crypto-markets copy.csv` dataset, which contains extensive cryptocurrency market data.

## Code
The primary code is contained within the `team4_Crypto.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This notebook encompasses data preprocessing, model development, and analysis.

## User Interface
An interactive dashboard is provided for enhanced user experience.

### Running the Application
- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
- Create a new directory and set up as instructed.
- Install required libraries via `pip`.
- For Flask or Jinja2 issues, follow the reinstallation steps.
- Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
- Access the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

**Note:** For accurate forecasting, select a target date on or before June 21, 2019.

### Steps to Run:
1. Prepare your environment (Python installation, directory setup).
2. Install necessary libraries (Flask, Pandas, Plotly, Sklearn).
3. Handle any library issues.
4. Start the Flask server.
5. Navigate to the provided local URL to use the application.

## Using the Dashboard
